# WorldMaker
Create an manipulate a small planet. Based on a a density function and a marching-cubes rendering method.

##TODO:
- [ ] Load density values into an array for rendering *This saves time since we don't need to compute densities every time*
- [ ] Set all air values not touching ground to zero *This should allow for more predictable building*
- [ ] Change random noise to be radial, not linear
    *Should give everything a nicer look*
